        <h2>Employment</h2>
        <h3>Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Sopra Steria (2022-Now)</h3>
        <p>During past years, Gang has led/contributed to a variety of projects for clients, including:</p>

        <h4>Infrastructure Standardization and Automation</h4>
        <p>Description: The current infrastructure management was manual, inconsistent, and lacked standardization, leading to inefficiencies and errors across different environments.</p>
        <p>Contribution: Standardized operating systems, automated VM provisioning and management.</p>
        <p>Value Created: Improved infrastructure consistency, reduced manual errors, enhanced security, and significantly sped up deployment times through automation.</p>

        <h4>Deploying Kubernetes and GitHub ARC</h4>
        <p>Description: The current use of GitHub runners on VMs caused conflicts and scalability issues due to a lack of isolation and standardized infrastructure management. A container orchestration platform was needed to run, scale, and manage GitHub action workflows.</p>
        <p>Contribution: Built Kubernetes cluster, set up GitHub ARC, and redesigned workflows to transition to containerized environments.</p>
        <p>Value Created: Improved isolation, scalability, and reliability, while reducing manual overhead through automated infrastructure management.</p>

        <h4>Automating Upgrading RHEL7 to RHEL8</h4>
        <p>Description: RHEL7 was approaching the end of support, so upgrading hundreds of RHEL7 systems became a high priority.</p>
        <p>Contribution: Designed the upgrading plan with application owners and automated the upgrade process using Ansible.</p>
        <p>Value Created: Ensured systems were aligned with security compliance standards and future-proofed the infrastructure.</p>

        <h4>Ansible Automation Platform on OpenShift</h4>
        <p>Description: The increasing number of playbooks, inventories, and workflows became difficult to manage manually. A central platform was needed to orchestrate and manage all Ansible-related elements.</p>
        <p>Contribution: Collaborated with teams to set up the OpenShift platform and deployed the Ansible Automation Platform on it.</p>
        <p>Value Created: Reduced manual tasks and errors, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced security by centralizing management of playbooks, inventories, and secrets.</p>

        <h4>Deploying Red Hat 9 to Production Infrastructure</h4>
        <p>Description: Needed to test and prepare RHEL9 for production use.</p>
        <p>Contribution: Deployed Red Hat 9 using Ansible, created a customized Red Hat image template for VMware, and integrated the system with Windows AD.</p>
        <p>Value Created: Enabled seamless deployment, ensured system compatibility, and prepared the OS for production environments.</p>

        <h4>Automating Patching of Red Hat VM</h4>
        <p>Description: The manual patching process for a large-scale Red Hat environment was time-consuming and prone to errors, necessitating an automated solution.</p>
        <p>Contribution: Designed and implemented an Ansible-based workflow with Red Hat Satellite to automate patching.</p>
        <p>Value Created: Streamlined patching, reduced errors, and improved system uptime and security across the infrastructure.</p>

        <h4>Automating the Provisioning of Red Hat VM</h4>
        <p>Description: The manual provisioning of large-scale Red Hat VMs was becoming impossible due to the scale.</p>
        <p>Contribution: Designed and implemented an Ansible-based workflow to automate the provisioning of VMs into the production environment.</p>
        <p>Value Created: Streamlined the installation, configuration, and management of VMs.</p>

        <h4>Deploying Critical Applications to Infrastructure</h4>
        <p>Description: A critical cloud-based application needed to be deployed, configured, and tested across the entire platform.</p>
        <p>Contribution: Took solo responsibility for installing, configuring, and troubleshooting the application.</p>
        <p>Value Created: Ensured that the system was aligned with organizational policies and operational requirements.</p>
