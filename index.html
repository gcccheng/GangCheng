                <h3>Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Sopra Steria</h3>
                <p>During past years, Gang has led/contributed to a variety of projects for clients, including:</p>
                
                <h4>Infrastructure Standardization and Automation</h4>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The current infrastructure management was manual, inconsistent, and lacked standardization, leading to inefficiencies and errors across different environments.</p>
                <p><strong>Contribution:</strong> Standardized operating systems, automated VM provisioning and management.</p>
                <p><strong>Value Created:</strong> Improved infrastructure consistency, reduced manual errors, enhanced security, and significantly sped up deployment times through automation.</p>

                <h4>Deploying Kubernetes and GitHub ARC</h4>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The current use of GitHub runners on VMs caused conflicts and scalability issues due to a lack of isolation and standardized infrastructure management. A container orchestration platform was needed to run, scale, and manage GitHub action workflows.</p>
                <p><strong>Contribution:</strong> Built Kubernetes cluster, set up GitHub ARC, and redesigned workflows to transition to containerized environments.</p>
                <p><strong>Value Created:</strong> Improved isolation, scalability, and reliability, while reducing manual overhead through automated infrastructure management.</p>
